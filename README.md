# networking_proj

This Flutter project demonstrates a networking solution that includes API integration, 
state management using BLoC, and clean architecture principles. The app handles user 
input and communicates with a backend API to send and receive data. Key features include 
form validation, error handling via mappers, and separation of concerns through domain-driven design.
The project also utilizes get_it for dependency injection, ensuring modularity and testability.
